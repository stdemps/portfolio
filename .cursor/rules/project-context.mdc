## About Steven Dempster Portfolio

**What it is:** A personal portfolio site showcasing product design work, experience, and testimonials — rebuilt in Next.js from an existing Framer site.

**Goals:**
- Help recruiters and hiring managers discover Steven's work and contact him easily
- Demonstrate product design skill and creative thinking through real project case studies

## Key Terminology

- **Framer site:** The original portfolio at stevendempster.framer.website that this Next.js build aims to match
- **Formspree:** Third-party form backend used for the contact form (configured via `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_FORM_ID`)
- **Fathom:** Privacy-focused analytics provider (configured via `NEXT_PUBLIC_FATHOM_SITE_ID`)

## User Personas

### Recruiter / Hiring Manager
- Role: Evaluating candidates for product design roles
- Goals: Quickly assess Steven's skills, see relevant work, and make contact
- Pain Points: Long load times, unclear navigation, no easy way to reach out

### Peer Designer / Collaborator
- Role: Fellow designer or potential collaborator exploring Steven's portfolio
- Goals: Understand Steven's design approach and craft quality
- Pain Points: Missing project visuals, placeholder content, lack of case study depth

## Product Philosophy

1. **Mobile-first simplicity:** Simple, clean, mobile-first design that works everywhere
2. **Ship fast, iterate:** Get a solid baseline live quickly and improve based on real feedback
3. **Content over chrome:** Real content and clear communication matter more than flashy effects

## Current Priorities

1. Match the Framer site design in the Next.js build (layout, typography, colours)
2. Replace placeholders with real project visuals, copy, and case studies
3. Proper SEO metadata (title, description) so the site ranks and shares well

## Design & Development Standards

### CRITICAL: Mobile-First Requirement
This project uses **mobile-first responsive design** for ALL features. Before starting any UI work:
- ✅ Review the [Responsive Design Checklist](../checklists/responsive-design-checklist.md)
- ✅ Start with mobile layout (no breakpoint prefix)
- ✅ Enhance for larger screens with `md:` and `lg:` prefixes
- ❌ NEVER build desktop-first and retrofit mobile

**Why this matters:** Building desktop-first and retrofitting mobile leads to significant rework, inconsistent patterns, and poor mobile user experience. The responsive design checklist and updated guidelines prevent this from happening.
